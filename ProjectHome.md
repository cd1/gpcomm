GP Comm provides a bridge to communicate with a smart card, using an existing API in the background (such as OpenCard Framework, Java Smart Card I/O, JPCSC). A developer can integrate any smart card communication API with GP Comm just by implementing some interfaces and linking those classes in a properties file. Additionally, this framework provides methods that correspond to all the commands defined by the GlobalPlatform 2.0.1'.
